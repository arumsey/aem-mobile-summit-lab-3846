## Built for Mac OS

This lab was developed for the Mac operating system. 
If you do not have an OS X machine, you can install the packages in `./AEMM-Labs/L3846/packages` onto your AEM author instance, and replicate them to publish.
Furthermore, the included sample application is an Xcode project which can only be used on a Mac OS.

## Need to Catch Up?

If you get stuck on a particular module and want to catch up to continue, there are severl catch up scripts included.

Each catch up script has the naming convention, `install-moduleX.command`. Where `X` is the module you are stuck on.

eg. `./AEMM-Labs/L3846/install-module2.command` will update your AEM instance to include all the content added during Module 2.
